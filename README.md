Consuming API using JS anad JSON

This project contains the code using HTML, Javascript, JSON and CSS to use the API pokeapi.co, access the database for all 807 pokemons and search for a specific pokemon with the input of the user by name or ID. 
If the pokemon is found, then it will display the pokemon picture and relevant data (name, id, type(s), height and weight) on the Internet browser window.

NOTE: it works only on more updated browsers as just recent browser can use JSON
